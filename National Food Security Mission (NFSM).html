    <b>About SMAM</b>
</p><br>
<p>
    <li>Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) is a submission launched under Krishonnati Yojana in 2014-15.</li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>The objectives of the scheme is to increase the reach of farm mechanization to small and marginal farmers and to the regions & difficult area where farm power availability is low.</li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>The scheme objective is to promote ‘Custom Hiring Centres’ and ‘Hi-tech Hubs of High-Value Machines’ to offset the adverse economies of scale arising due to small and fragmented landholding and high cost of individual ownership.</li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>To boost up mechanization in the agriculture sector improved agricultural implements and machinery are essential inputs for modern agriculture that enhance the productivity of crops besides reducing human drudgery and cost of cultivation</li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>Mechanization also helps in improving the utilization efficiency of other inputs therefore considered to be one of the most important segments of the agriculture sector to boost the income of farmers and growth of the agricultural economy.</li>
