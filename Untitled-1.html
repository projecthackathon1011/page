        The <b>PM-KISAN (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi) Scheme</b>, also known as PMKSNY, was launched on February 1, 2019, a government-run scheme to support farmers. This scheme ensures that the farmers get ₹6,000 (equivalent to ₹6,300 or US$84 in 2020) per year as minimum income support. Piyush Goyal announced the initiative during the 2019 Interim Union Budget of India. This scheme assures a fixed amount of 6000 rupees per annum which the government will deposit directly in the eligible farmers’ bank accounts. Each farmer will receive Rs.6000 payable in three equal four monthly installments of Rs.2000 each. The usage of these funds is completely at the will of the farmer. The funding is solely from the Government of India using Direct  Benefit Transfer (DBT).</p><br>
