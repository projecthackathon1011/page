                The NIRVIK Scheme is aimed at providing high insurance coverage for exporters while reducing the premiums on small-scale exporters. It is believed that such a move will lead to higher export credit disbursement.

                The scheme was announced at a time when 10 of the 30 exporting sectors showed a sharp decline with respect to outbound shipment in 2019. Indiaâ€™s exports in December 2019 fell for the fifth time in a row by around 1.8% to  USD  357.39  billion,  leaving  a  trade deficit of USD 118.10 billion.

                The development of the NIRVIK Scheme was significant as exporters were concerned about credit availability. As it happened credit disbursement declined to Rs 9.57 lakh crore in 2018-2019 from Rs 12.39 lakh crore in 2017-18.
